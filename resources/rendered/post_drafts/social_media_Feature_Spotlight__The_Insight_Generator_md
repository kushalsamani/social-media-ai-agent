Numbers are just numbers until you know what to do with them. 📈

Most SMB owners are 'data-rich but insight-poor.' You have the engagement stats, but do you know *why* that one post went viral on a Tuesday morning? 

Introducing Feature Spotlight: The Insight Generator. 

Our tool doesn't just organize your Excel rows; it interprets them. By analyzing your historical data, our AI provides plain-English recommendations like:

👉 'Your video engagement is 40% higher when you post between 6-7 PM. Shift your schedule to maximize reach.'
👉 'Keyword "Sustainability" is driving 3x more conversions than "Eco-friendly." Update your SEO strategy.'

It’s like having a senior marketing consultant living inside your spreadsheet.
