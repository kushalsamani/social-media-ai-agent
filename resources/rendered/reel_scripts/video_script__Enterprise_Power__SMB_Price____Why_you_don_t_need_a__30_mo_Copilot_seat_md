"Why pay $30 a month for a generalist AI when you can get a specialized social data expert for half that? [Visual: Price comparison graphic]. Microsoft Copilot is great, but it doesn't know the difference between a TikTok 'Like' and a Meta 'Conversion' export without a lot of prompting. Our tool is built specifically for SMMs and SMBs. It’s pre-loaded with social logic to clean your data and build your reports instantly. Enterprise power, SMB price. Sign up today for just $15 a month and stop overpaying for general AI."
