Visual: Split screen.
Left Side (Manual): A timer starts at 0:00. SMM is frantically typing VLOOKUP formulas and dragging cells. Sweat on forehead.
Right Side (AI): SMM types one sentence: 'Analyze these 500 rows of TikTok data and create a summary table.'

Action: At 0:15, the Right Side is finished. A clean, color-coded table appears with a 'Best Posting Time' chart. The Left Side timer is at 15:00 and they are still fixing a #REF error.

Voiceover: 'Manual data cleaning takes 30 minutes. Our AI tool does it in 30 seconds. Which one would you choose?'

Text Overlay: 30 Mins vs. 30 Seconds.
