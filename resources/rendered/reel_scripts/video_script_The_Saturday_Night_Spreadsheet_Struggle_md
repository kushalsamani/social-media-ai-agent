Visual: Dark room, only light comes from a laptop screen reflecting off the SMM's tired face. Clock on the wall shows 8:30 PM. Audio: Sad violin music.

Text Overlay: POV: It's Saturday night and you're still cleaning CSV exports from the week.

Action: SMM clicks 'Delete Column' over and over, sighing. Suddenly, the screen glows bright green. The AI-Powered Tool logo appears.

Audio: Upbeat, futuristic 'ding'. Music shifts to high-energy lo-fi.

Action: SMM types 'Clean this report and highlight top performing posts' into the AI prompt. The spreadsheet organizes itself instantly. SMM closes laptop and grabs a coat to head out.

Voiceover: 'Stop wasting your weekends on manual data entry. Let our AI Agent handle the spreadsheets while you handle the social life.'
