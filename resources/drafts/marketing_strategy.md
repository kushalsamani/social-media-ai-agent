## 1. Executive Summary
Based on our market research, we are positioning our product as the **"Data Scientist in Your Spreadsheet."** While generic AI spreadsheet tools exist, our competitive advantage lies in **social-media-specific logic**. This strategy focuses on a high-efficiency, $10,000 launch budget designed to capture Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) and Social Media Managers (SMMs) who are currently "data-rich but insight-poor."

## 2. Target Audience Segmentation

| Segment | Primary Pain Point | Core Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Data-Drowned" Agency Manager** | Spends 10+ hours/week on manual client reporting and data cleaning. | **Scalability:** Automate reporting to handle 2x the clients with the same headcount. |
| **The "Solopreneur" SMB Owner** | Lacks technical Excel skills; overwhelmed by raw data from Meta/TikTok. | **Simplicity:** High-level strategic insights without needing to learn formulas or VBA. |
| **The Freelance SMM** | Struggles to prove ROI to clients; needs professional visualizations. | **Authority:** Professional-grade macros that generate "Best Posting Time" and "ROI" charts instantly. |
