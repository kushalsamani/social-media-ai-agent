## 1. Keyword Analysis & SEO Strategy

In 2026, SEO has shifted toward **Natural Language Queries (NLQ)** and **Problem-Based Search**. Our keyword strategy focuses on "how-to" intent and "tool-gap" keywords where users are frustrated with manual spreadsheet work.

### Primary Keywords (High Volume/Core Intent)
*   **AI Excel Formula Generator for Marketing:** (Trend: +140% YoY) – Users looking for immediate fixes to complex marketing math.
*   **Automate Social Media Reporting Excel:** (Trend: +85% YoY) – High intent from agency managers looking to scale.
*   **Social Media ROI Macro:** (Niche/High Conversion) – Specific to SMMs who need to prove value to stakeholders.
*   **AI Spreadsheet Assistant for SMBs:** General discovery keyword for business owners.

### Long-Tail & Semantic Keywords (The "Pain Point" Queries)
*   *"How to clean TikTok export data in Excel"*
*   *"VBA macro for Instagram engagement tracking"*
*   *"Pivot table for social media search trends 2026"*
*   *"AI tool to turn CSV into marketing dashboard"*
*   *"Automated sentiment analysis in Excel without coding"*

### Keyword Difficulty & Opportunity
Most competitors (like Hootsuite) rank for "Social Media Management," while tools like Numerous.ai rank for "AI Sheets." There is a **"Blue Ocean" opportunity** in ranking for **"Social Media Data Automation,"** where searchers are looking for the *technical execution* of data analysis rather than just scheduling posts.

## 2. Competitor Blog Insights

Analysis of the top three competitors reveals a content gap in **specialized technical execution.**

| Competitor | Content Strength | Content Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Numerous.ai** | General "How-to" for ChatGPT in Sheets. | Lacks industry-specific workflows (e.g., how to handle a Meta Business Suite export). |
| **Formula Bot** | Quick-fix formula generation. | Content is "one-and-done." No long-term strategy on building a reporting ecosystem. |
| **Sprout Social** | High-level strategy and "State of Social" reports. | Too expensive for SMBs; their blog assumes you are using their native (expensive) reporting. |

**The Opportunity:** Our blog should focus on **"The Bridge."** We write for the person who *has* the data (from Meta/TikTok) but *loses* the thread in Excel. We will win by providing the exact prompts and macros that competitors leave to the user's imagination.
