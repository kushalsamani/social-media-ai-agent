### **3. Competitor Analysis**
*   **Microsoft Copilot (Excel):** High authority, but users find it too broad. Content focuses on general productivity, not specific "Social Logic."

*   **Opportunity:** Address the "Excel Reality"—acknowledge that people *want* to use Excel for custom reports and offer a way to make it painless.
